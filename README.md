# Son of Attila
The Son of Attila is my own fork of the wonderfully awesome Attila theme (details below). I've modified a few things to make the theme less newsletter and more like a plain ol' corporate website, as I use it for my company's site, Kyloson LLC (<https://kyloson.com>). Changes include:

* Removing the Subscribe/Sign In links at the top of `default.hbs`.
* Defaulting to dark mode and removing the mode selector link in the page footer.
* Adding dropdown menus for non-mobile (992px+ width).
* More to come...

---- Below here are details and build instructions from the original repository. ----
